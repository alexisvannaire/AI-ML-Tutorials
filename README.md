## Project 1: Create a single-neuron, single-layer Neural Network using Numpy

How to create a single-layer, single-neuron Neural Network using Numpy, get a clear understanding of the basic workings of neural networks and explore how different parameters affect its training.

You'll find a jupyter notebook in the `single_neuron_mlp` folder.

## Project 2: How are random numbers generated?

An introduction to pseudorandom number generators: how they work, what a 'seed' is, how to implement them in Python, and how to visualize some of their common flaws.

You'll find a jupyter notebook in the `introduction-to-PRNGs` folder.
