# How are random numbers generated?
This project gives an introduction of pseudorandom number generators using Python. 
The aim is to provide a first look with three important ones: the Middle-square method, the Linear Congruential Generator and the Mersenne Twister. You'll have the codes, examples and visualizations that show some of their common flaws.

## Project Structure

* `introduction-to-PRNGs.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the implementation and explanations.
* `img/`: Directory to store images used in the notebook.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
