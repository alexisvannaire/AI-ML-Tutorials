# Create a single-neuron, single-layer Neural Network usingÂ Numpy
 
This project demonstrates how to create a single-layer, single-neuron Neural Network using Numpy. The aim is to provide a clear understanding of the basic workings of neural networks and explore how different parameters affect its training.

## Project Structure

* `single_neuron_mlp.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the implementation and explanations.
* `generate_gif.py`: Python file containing the functions used to generate gif files.
* `plot/`: Directory to store generated plots.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* imageio (for gif generation)
